# Basic-Algorithm-Unit-Testing
Unit testing for Free Code Camp's basic algorithm scripting  

I am currently working though these lessons. 

Once I finish the challenges, I will provide my answers on the master branch, but have blank fills in "following" branch for campers going though the challenges and want to use their own text editors and have the same unit tests using mocha
